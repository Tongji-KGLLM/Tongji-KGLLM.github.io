# About Knowledge Computing Lab

The Knowledge Computing Lab (KCL) of Tongji University, founded by [Prof. Haofen Wang](/people/wang-haofen/) in 2020, is an academic group committed to pioneering research in the fields of knowledge graphs and natural language processing. With an eye towards leveraging large language models (LLMs) and multimodal knowledge graphs, KCL aims to drive innovation in knowledge representation, extraction, and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Our mission is to harness the potential of knowledge in the era of LLMs and the research areas encompass:

- Knowledge Graphs
- Retrieval/Knowledge-Augmented Large Language Models
- Multimodal Knowledge Reasoning
- Intelligent Question Answering Systems

Our goal is to evolve into a world-class laboratory, dedicated to propelling AI technologies forward and applying them across diverse domains such as education, healthcare, and finance, thereby generating significant value for society.
