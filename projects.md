# Research Projects

Here are some of the main research projects currently underway in our lab:

1. **Intelligent Medical Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Automatically extract medical knowledge from medical literature and clinical records using natural language processing techniques to build a comprehensive medical knowledge graph.

2. **Multilingual Large-scale Pre-trained Language Models**
   - Develop large-scale pre-trained language models supporting multiple languages to improve model performance in cross-lingual tasks.

3. **Knowledge-enhanced Dialogue Systems**
   - Combine knowledge graphs with large language models to develop intelligent dialogue systems with rich knowledge backgrounds.
